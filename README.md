# CS-225
Coding assignments for CS255: Data Structures at UIUC. Assignments include implementations and/or use of heaps, various types of trees, graphs, linked lists, sets, huffman trees, and hash maps. First class taken which used C++, so all assignments also allowed me to learn more about the language and develop my skills with it.

Developers: Cain Gonzalez and CS225 staff
